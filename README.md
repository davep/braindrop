# braindrop

Coming soon.

## TODO

Things I'm considering adding or addressing:

- [X] Textual's help system is keyboard-hostile despite being of most use to
      keyboard-first users. Replace the current slide-in help panel with
      something useful and helpful.
      [#1](https://github.com/davep/braindrop/issues/1)
- [ ] Add a user information dialog. There's some useful information about
      the user, so add a little dialog that will show it.
